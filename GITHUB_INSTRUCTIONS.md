# GitHub Push Instructions

Follow these steps to push your dashboard project to GitHub:

## 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "react-dashboard")
4. Optionally add a description
5. Choose whether to make it public or private
6. Leave "Initialize this repository with a README" unchecked
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Initialize Git in Your Project (if not already done)

Open a terminal/command prompt in your project directory and run:

```
cd dashboard
git init
```

## 3. Add Your Files to Git

```
git add .
```

## 4. Commit Your Files

```
git commit -m "Initial commit: Dashboard project"
```

## 5. Add GitHub as Remote Repository

Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username and `repository-name` with the name you chose:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
```

## 6. Push Your Code to GitHub

```
git push -u origin main
```

Note: If your default branch is called "master" instead of "main", use:

```
git push -u origin master
```

## 7. Verify Your Repository

Go to your GitHub repository URL to confirm that all files have been uploaded successfully:

```
https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

If you encounter authentication issues, you may need to:

1. Use a personal access token instead of a password
2. Set up SSH keys for GitHub

Visit GitHub's documentation on [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) or [Setting up SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) for more information.
